## Brokenithm-Android

A version of Brokenithm, inspired by the [Brokenithm-iOS](https://github.com/esterTion/Brokenithm-iOS) project.
Supports UDP and TCP connection to host, UDP for Wireless connection and TCP for `adb reverse` port forward (over USB for lower latency?).

The Windows server is in [another repository](https://github.com/tindy2013/Brokenithm-Android-Server).
